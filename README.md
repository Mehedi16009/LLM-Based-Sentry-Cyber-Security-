# LLM-Based-Sentry-Cyber-Security-
LLM-Sentry is a hybrid detection pipeline combining real-time retrieval (FAISS), prompt similarity (SBERT), and fine-tuned classification (DistilBERT) trained on JailbreakBench. It supports adaptive learning through HITL updates and performs real-time filtering in a modular, reproducible Google Colab environment.
